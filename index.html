    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="date">Effective Date: 11 January 2026</div>

    <p>
        Smart Public Services App ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting
        the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how information
        is handled when you use our mobile application.
    </p>

    <p>
        By using this app, you agree to the terms described in this Privacy Policy.

    <h2>1. About the App</h2>
    <p>
        Smart Public Services App is a utility-based mobile application that provides
        users with convenient access to various public service and government-related
        websites through a simplified and mobile-friendly interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app acts only as a gateway and does not represent, replace, or claim
        affiliation with any government authority or official organization.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>No Personal Data Collection</strong>
    </div>
    <p>

        <li>No tracking or profiling is performed</li>
        <li>No analytics that identify users are used</li>

    <p>
        Any information entered by the user is submitted directly to official
        third-party websites accessed through the app.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Camera Permission Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The app may request access to the device camera only when explicitly
        initiated by the user.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uploading documents or images</li>
        <li>Capturing photos using the system file chooser</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Camera access is never automatic and is always under user control.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The camera is never accessed in the background</li>
        <li>No photos or videos are stored by the app</li>
        <li>No camera data is collected or shared</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Internet Permission</h2>

        Internet access is required for the app to function properly. It is used
        solely to load and display official public service websites.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Websites</h2>
    <p>
        The app contains links to external third-party websites. We do not control
        and are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of
        these websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of any third-party

        from children under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since the app does not collect or store personal data, there is no risk of
        user data being exposed or misused by the app itself.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        posted on this page with an updated effective date.
